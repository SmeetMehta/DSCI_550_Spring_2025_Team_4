He thought this was odd considering its near midnight, it's raining, and at the time the school was practically in the middle of the desert. So with out taking his eyes off of them he began to approach them to ask them if they might need a ride or shelter from the rain. As he got half way near the fountain the male figure wearing a varsity jacket turned to him, the girl wearing a pretty prom like dress stood up and turned towards the caretaker, that's when he realiz ed they hadn't been affected by the rain... there clothes were completely dried and puffy!

Directions to follow the story, It is said that long ago the woman that owned it hung herself in the attic\/which has been converted to the office\/storage space for whatever business inhabits the building. The small basement has been used as a liquor\/storage room. The building has several dining areas with fireplaces in each one that have been converted to gas. Employees of then Spaso Speakeasy were almost asphyxiated by gas fumes when setting up before opening one day, everybody began to get sick, it was later discovered that the gas for the fireplaces had been turned on but not lit. For years employees have complained that the pull chain light switch at the top of the basement stairs, gets pulled and the light goes out, forcing you to either try maneuvering the stairs in the dark or leave the lower light on, if you walk up the stairs and turn it on and go back down to finish what you are doing, the light chain gets pulled, and the light goes out. There are secret panels and rooms behind the walls, that very few people are aware of, their purpose is unknown at this time. One in particular is between the front entranceway and the kitchen, along the wall to the left. The bar area is particularly active, and things disappear and reappear, such as a corkscrew that disappeared. After exhaustive searching, the manager went out and purchased another one, a few hours later, the missing corkscrew was simply sitting out in plain sight on the bar, in the open. The ghost has been called Mrs. Murphy, although, it is not known if that was\/is the true name, and is more like a trickster than a specter. Just an odd note, a Halloween party was held in the year 1989, (then Spaso Speakeasy) a raffle was given for door prizes and the first ticket drawn was *0666, No one held that ticket and it was not in sequence with the role of tickets being used. Most\/all businesses in this building have failed, it is\/was near the corner of North Avenue and Route 83, If you start out at the intersection of North and York, travel toward Route 83, it is on the right side, one business from the corner, a Peppers Waterbed Store used to be the business just past it. It is within visual distance of the Golden Pheasant restaurant, which is across 83, and on the left. -  December 2005 correction\/Update: The Stone Cottage Pizza building in Elmhurst is still there. It had been converted to a relatively popular bar and grill. That business, on westbound North Ave. has failed. There is a sign on it saying, \"scheduled for commercial redevelopment\". Parking availability cannot be blamed for it's closing. The Golden Pheasant restaurant mentioned in the same spot on the eastbound side of North Ave. still flourishes with the same amount of space. North Ave and Route 83, is reported to be the busiest intersection in the state. - March 2007 Update: It is being torn down with two next door establishments and will probably be use for mini-strip mall or something like that. - October 2007 Update: It has been demolished.."

Naturally, I thought it was just a change in the wind, sudden drop in pressure, etc., so I went back one night with a girl I was dating and a friend. We were sitting in the car talking when I felt a horrible feeling that someone was right on me. At the same time the girl I was with began to scream and tell me to get out of here, start the car! We flew out of there at full speed and kept speeding down the narrow two-lane road that led to it. Even though we had left the area and were a half mile away, she continued to look out the back window and say that someone is coming, and our friend was saying \"go, man, go! Don't slow down!\" I felt it too, and turned to look out the back window to see what it was; I lost control on the dirt road and my car went down a steep hill into some trees. We were at the bottom of this hill and all any of us could do was yell excitedly in fear at what might be out there. To this day, neither I nor any of my many friends who used to go out there will even turn down the road that leads to it at night.

This building is definitely haunted; witnesses have heard noises from the upper floor and seen lights near the fountain at night.

There is also a cemetery just to the north of the building, graves disturbed and a large cross has been cut down. Town legend says that the teenagers that cut it down in the 70's all died that year.

She stands next to the US Highway 70 Underpass in a white evening gown and waves frantically for someone to stop and pick her up. Those hapless travelers who do are introduced to a young woman who says her name is Lydia and she always ask them to please take her to an address in High Point. She always tells them that she has spent the evening at a dance in Raleigh and is anxious to get home, having run into car trouble on the way. Just as the drivers approach the house, the girl always vanishes from their car, never opening the door and getting out.-  March 2004 additional info: There are many versions to the story but the most common one that I have heard is that Lydia was at a dance one night and was trying to get home. A car apparently hit her and now she hitches rides home from the bridge. When the person gets her to her house, she disappears. She never says anything other than her name is Lydia; she needs to get home, and her address. Another story posted on www.dawghouse.topcities.com\/northcarolina.html.  Either way, she died in 1923. The road that linked High Point and Greensboro was a different road than is there now. There are train tracks that are the reason for the bridge. The bridge now is called the graffiti bridge, for obvious reasons. To the left of this bridge, about 40 ft away and hidden in massive amounts of kudzu, is where the original bridge is, and it's Lydia's bridge. There is another bridge about 2 miles away from these that is also believed to be Lydia's bridge. This one is an actual bridge that you drive over and it's over a creek. Some kids have spray painted pentagrams on it which is kind of freaky but at the same time, there is a sort of eerie presence here. One report of a group of friends in the 80\u2019s that would venture there had two girls in this group and every time they would get close to the bridge, the girls would pass out. www.hauntednc.com says that Lydia is merely an urban legend. Which bridge is really her bridge? How did she die? Why was she walking home? Or was she in the car with her date? Where\u2019s a newspaper article or an obituary that can prove to us that this happened? If she died at the bridge close to the graffiti bridge, one wonders who is haunting the one over the creek? Why would kids choose that bridge to paint pentagrams on?."
